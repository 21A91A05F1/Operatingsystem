Difference between vertical and horizontal scaling :

Scaling:
=======
Scaling alters the size of a system. In the scaling process,
we either compress or expand the system to meet the expected needs.
The scaling operation can be achieved by adding resources to meet the smaller expectation in the current system, 
or by adding a new system in the existing one, or both.

Vertical scaling and horizontal scaling are two approaches to increasing the capacity 
or performance of a system, and they involve different strategies for handling increased demand or load.

Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):
============================
Definition: Vertical scaling involves adding more resources (such as CPU, RAM, or storage) to a single machine or node in a system.
==========
Vertical scaling keeps your existing infrastructure but adds computing power. 
Your existing pool of code does not need to change â€” you simply need to run the same code on machines
with better specs. By scaling up, you increase the capacity of a single machine and increase
its throughput. Vertical scaling allows data to live on a single node, and scaling spreads
the load through CPU and RAM resources for your machines.

Example: Upgrading a server by adding more CPU cores, increasing RAM, or using a more powerful processor.
========
Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):
================================
Definition: Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines or nodes to a distributed system.
==========
Horizontal scaling simply adds more instances of machines without first implementing 
improvements to existing specifications. By scaling out, you share the processing power
and load balancing across multiple machines.

Example: Adding more servers to a web application to distribute the incoming traffic and share the load.

Choosing between Vertical and Horizontal Scaling:
========  ======= ======== === =================
Use Case: The choice often depends on the specific use case, workload, and the architecture of the application.
Limits of Vertical Scaling: If a system reaches the limits of vertical scaling (e.g., due to hardware constraints),
horizontal scaling becomes a natural choice.
Cloud Environments: Horizontal scaling is commonly used in cloud environments where adding or removing virtual machines is more flexible.

In many modern systems, a combination of both vertical and horizontal scaling is employed to achieve the desired performance,
scalability, and fault tolerance. This approach is often referred to as "scaling up" and "scaling out" simultaneously.
