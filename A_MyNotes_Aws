AWS Global Infrastructure::

What is an AWS Region?
An AWS Region is a separate geographic area where AWS provides a set of cloud services.
Each Region consists of multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.

What is an Availability Zone?
An Availability Zone (AZ) is a distinct location within a Region that is isolated from other AZs in the same Region.
Each AZ has its own power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.

What are Edge Locations?
Edge Locations are part of AWS's content delivery network (CDN), known as Amazon CloudFront.
They are used to cache copies of content closer to end-users, reducing latency and improving the user experience.

AWS Global Accelerator

AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the availability and performance
of your applications with a global user base. It uses the vast AWS global network infrastructure to
direct your user traffic to optimal endpoints.

AWS Direct Connect

AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that establishes a dedicated network connection
from your premises to AWS. This dedicated connection can increase bandwidth throughput 
and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.

2. Compute Services

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Overview
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 
It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers by offering a variety of instance types
and pricing options to suit different workloads.

Key Features:
Virtual Servers (Instances): Launch and manage virtual servers to run applications.
Instance Types: Wide selection of instance types optimized for different use cases (e.g., compute-intensive,
memory-intensive, storage-intensive).
Scalability: Easily scale up or down based on demand.
Flexible Pricing:
On-Demand: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments.
Reserved Instances: Save up to 75% over On-Demand by committing to a one- or three-year term.
Spot Instances: Bid for unused capacity and get up to 90% discount.
Elastic Block Store (EBS): Persistent block storage for EC2 instances.
Security: Secure, isolated instances with customizable security groups and network configurations.
Networking: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation and advanced networking features.
Elasticity: Auto Scaling to automatically adjust capacity based on demand.

Use Cases:
Web Hosting: Host websites and web applications with varying traffic patterns.
Big Data and Analytics: Run large-scale data processing workloads.
Machine Learning: Train and deploy machine learning models.
High Performance Computing (HPC): Perform complex simulations and calculations.
Dev/Test Environments: Quickly set up and tear down development and testing environments.
============================
AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
It automatically scales applications by running code in response to triggers from other AWS services or HTTP
requests via Amazon API Gateway.

Key Features:
Serverless: No need to manage infrastructure; focus solely on writing code.
Automatic Scaling: Scales automatically with the size of the workload, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
Event-Driven: Executes code in response to events from services like S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SNS, and API Gateway.
Cost-Efficiency: Pay only for the compute time you consume—billed in 1ms increments.
Integrated with AWS Services: Seamlessly integrates with various AWS services for triggering functions, 
managing application state, and more.
Support for Multiple Languages: Supports Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, .NET Core, and custom runtimes.
Short Execution Time: Each function execution can last up to 15 minutes.
Use Cases:
Data Processing: Real-time file processing, data transformation, and ETL tasks.
Web Backends: Create serverless APIs and backend services.
Automation: Automate operational tasks and workflows.
IoT Backends: Process data from IoT devices in real-time.
Mobile Backends: Build backends for mobile applications with low latency.
========================================
AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a fully managed tool for running Docker containers. 
It makes it easy to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. ECS works well with
other AWS services and lets you run apps without managing servers using
AWS Fargate or by managing clusters of EC2 instances.
==========================================
AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a fully managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS.
It simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes. 
EKS integrates with other AWS services for security, scalability, and monitoring,
allowing you to run Kubernetes without managing the underlying infrastructure.
=================================================================================================
3. Storage Services

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service that lets you store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. 
It is designed for durability, scalability, and security. You can store different types of data like photos, videos, 
and documents in "buckets," which are like containers. S3 offers features like versioning to keep multiple versions of an object, 
and lifecycle policies to manage data automatically. It's widely used for backup, data archiving, big data analytics, and hosting
static websites. S3 integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, ensuring easy and efficient data management.
