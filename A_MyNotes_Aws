AWS Global Infrastructure::

What is an AWS Region?
An AWS Region is a separate geographic area where AWS provides a set of cloud services.
Each Region consists of multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.

What is an Availability Zone?
An Availability Zone (AZ) is a distinct location within a Region that is isolated from other AZs in the same Region.
Each AZ has its own power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.

What are Edge Locations?
Edge Locations are part of AWS's content delivery network (CDN), known as Amazon CloudFront.
They are used to cache copies of content closer to end-users, reducing latency and improving the user experience.
