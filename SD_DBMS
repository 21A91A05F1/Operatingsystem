What is DBMS ? Mention advantages.. 
    Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.
    A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.
    The most widely used types of DBMS software are relational, distributed, hierarchical, object-oriented, and network.
    Distributed database management system:
          A distributed DBMS is a set of logically interrelated databases distributed over a network that is managed by a centralized database application.
          This type of DBMS synchronizes data periodically and ensures that any change to data is universally updated in the database.
          
    Hierarchical database management system:
          Hierarchical databases organize model data in a tree-like structure. 
          Data storage is either a top-down or bottom-up format and is represented using a parent-child relationship.
          
    Network database management system:
          The network database model addresses the need for more complex relationships by allowing each child to have multiple parents.
          Entities are organized in a graph that can be accessed through several paths.
          
    Relational database management system:
          Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are the most popular data model because of its user-friendly interface.
          It is based on normalizing data in the rows and columns of the tables. 
          This is a viable option when you need a data storage system that is scalable, flexible, and able to manage lots of information.
          
    Object-oriented database management system:
          Object-oriented models store data in objects instead of rows and columns. 
          It is based on object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects to have members such as fields, properties, and methods.

What is database??
      A database is an organised collection of structured information, or data.
      A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating. 
      Computer databases typically store aggregations of data records or files that contain information, such as sales transactions, customer data, financials and product information.
      Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data. 
      They collect information on people, places or things. 
      That information is gathered in one place so that it can be observed and analyzed. 
      Databases can be thought of as an organized collection of information.
