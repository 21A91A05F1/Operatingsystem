What is DBMS ? Mention advantages.. 
    Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.
    A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.
    The most widely used types of DBMS software are relational, distributed, hierarchical, object-oriented, and network.
    Distributed database management system:
          A distributed DBMS is a set of logically interrelated databases distributed over a network that is managed by a centralized database application.
          This type of DBMS synchronizes data periodically and ensures that any change to data is universally updated in the database.
          
    Hierarchical database management system:
          Hierarchical databases organize model data in a tree-like structure. 
          Data storage is either a top-down or bottom-up format and is represented using a parent-child relationship.
          
    Network database management system:
          The network database model addresses the need for more complex relationships by allowing each child to have multiple parents.
          Entities are organized in a graph that can be accessed through several paths.
          
    Relational database management system:
          Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are the most popular data model because of its user-friendly interface.
          It is based on normalizing data in the rows and columns of the tables. 
          This is a viable option when you need a data storage system that is scalable, flexible, and able to manage lots of information.
          
    Object-oriented database management system:
          Object-oriented models store data in objects instead of rows and columns. 
          It is based on object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects to have members such as fields, properties, and methods.

What is database??
      A database is an organised collection of structured information, or data.
      A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating. 
      Computer databases typically store aggregations of data records or files that contain information, such as sales transactions, customer data, financials and product information.
      Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data. 
      They collect information on people, places or things. 
      That information is gathered in one place so that it can be observed and analyzed. 
      Databases can be thought of as an organized collection of information.

What is a database system? 
      A database system is a software-based solution that facilitates the organization, storage, retrieval, and management of data.
      A database system is a digital tool that helps you keep your information in order, making it accessible and manageable whenever you need it.
======================================================================
What is RDBMS ? Properties.. 
      
    A Relational Database Management system (RDBMS) is a database management system that is based on the relational model. 
    It has the following major components: Table, Record/Tuple/Row, Field, and Column/Attribute. 
    Examples of the most popular RDBMS are MYSQL, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server database.
=============================================================================
Proprties:
    Relational databases have the following properties:
    
    Values are atomic.
    All of the values in a column have the same data type.
    Each row is unique.
    The sequence of columns is insignificant.
        It means that the order in which you define or retrieve columns in a table doesn't affect how the database stores or retrieves the data
    The sequence of rows is insignificant.
        The order in which rows are stored in a table or retrieved from a table does not affect the logical structure of the data
    Each column has a unique name.
    Integrity constraints maintain data consistency across multiple tables.
        Primary Key Constraint:
    
                Ensures that each row in a table has a unique identifier, preventing duplicate entries. This is often used for linking tables together.
        Foreign Key Constraint:
                
                Defines a relationship between two tables, ensuring that values in one table's column match the values in another table's column. This maintains referential integrity.
        Unique Constraint:
                
                Ensures that values in a particular column (or a combination of columns) are unique across the entire table, preventing duplicates.
        Check Constraint:
                
                Specifies a condition that each row must satisfy. For instance, a check constraint can ensure that ages in a table are always positive.
=====================================================================================
Types of database languages :
Data Definition Language: (CAD)
        DDL stands for Data Definition Language.
        It is used to define database structure or pattern.
        DDL in SQL includes commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP,

        which are used to define and modify the structure of a database.
Data Manipulation Language: (SIAD)
        DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. 
        It is used for accessing and manipulating data in a database. It handles user requests.
        DML includes commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, which are used to retrieve, insert, modify, and delete data in a database.
Data Control Language:(GR)
        DCL stands for Data Control Language. 
        It is used to retrieve the stored or saved data.
        DCL includes commands like GRANT and REVOKE, 
        which are used to control access to data within a database.
Transaction Control Language:(CRS)
        TCL is used to run the changes made by the DML statement.
        TCL can be grouped into a logical transaction.
        TCL includes commands like COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT,
        which are used to manage transactions in a database.
=======================================================
Commands:
CREATE TABLE
The CREATE TABLE command creates a new table in the database.
Syntax:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);

ALTER TABLE
The ALTER TABLE command adds, deletes, or modifies columns in a table.
The ALTER TABLE command also adds and deletes various constraints in a table.
Syntax:
ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD Email varchar(255);

DROP TABLE
The DROP TABLE command deletes a table in the database.
Syntax:
DROP TABLE Shippers;

TRUNCATE TABLE
The TRUNCATE TABLE command deletes the data inside a table, but not the table itself.
Syntax:
TRUNCATE TABLE Categories;

==
SELECT DML Command:
The SELECT command shows the records of the specified table.
It also shows the particular record of a particular column by using the WHERE clause.

Syntax of SELECT DML command
SELECT column_Name_1, column_Name_2, ….., column_Name_N FROM Name_of_table;

INSERT DML Command:
It allows users to insert data in database tables.
Syntax:
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME ( column_Name1 , column_Name2 , column_Name3 , .... column_NameN )

UPDATE DML Command:
It allows users to update or modify the existing data in database tables.

Syntax of UPDATE Command
UPDATE Table_name SET [column_name1= value_1, ….., column_nameN = value_N] WHERE CONDITION;  
Here, 'UPDATE', 'SET', and 'WHERE' are the SQL keywords, and 'Table_name' is the name of the table whose values you want to update.

DELETE DML Command:

DELETE is a DML command which allows SQL users to remove single or multiple existing records from the database tables.
This command of Data Manipulation Language does not delete the stored data permanently from the database.
We use the WHERE clause with the DELETE command to select specific rows from the table.

Syntax of DELETE Command

DELETE FROM Table_Name WHERE condition; 
=================================
The SQL Grant command:
It is used especially to grant users access to database objects.
Users can also provide permissions to other users using this command.

Syntax:
GRANT privilege_name ON object_name
to {user_name | public | role_name}
Explaination:
Here, the public is used to allow access to all users, object_name is the name of the database object, 
user_name is the user to whom access should be granted, and privilege_name is the permission that needs to be granted.

What is revoke????
The REVOKE command is used to revoke previously granted privileges from a user or a group of users.
It allows the database administrator to remove specific privileges,
thereby restricting access to certain database objects.
Syntax:
REVOKE privilege_name ON object_name
from {user_name | public | role_name}

Grant ---privilege--> database object
Revoke <-----Revokes privilege --- data base object

==========
The COMMIT Command
The COMMIT command is the transactional command used to save changes invoked by a transaction. 
It saves all the transactions occurred on the database since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

The ROLLBACK Command
The ROLLBACK command is the transactional command used to undo transactions that have not already been saved to the database.
This command can only undo transactions since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

The SAVEPOINT Command
A SAVEPOINT is a logical rollback point in a transaction.
Usually, when you execute the ROLLBACK command, it undoes the changes until the last COMMIT. 
But, if you create save points you can partially roll the transaction back to these points.
You can create multiple save points between two commits.

The syntax to create a SAVEPOINT among the transactions is as shown below.

SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
