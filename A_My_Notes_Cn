Define network 
A network is a set of devices that are connected with a physical media link. In
a network, two or more nodes are connected by a physical link or two or more networks are connected by one or more nodes.
A network is a collection of devices connected to each other to allow the sharing of data.

What do you mean by network topology, and explain types of them ??
Network topology is the arrangement of nodes and links of a network.
Topologies are categorized as either physical network topology or logical network topology.
The topology of a network is key to determining its performance.
Network topology can be categorized into – Bus Topology, Ring Topology, Star Topology, Mesh Topology, Tree Topology.

What is Network?
A network is a collection of two or more devices connected by communication links so that they can communicate 
with each other and share resources and information. 

Some examples of networks are email, instant messaging, banking, etc. 

Components of a Network 

• Device: Device means any entity connected to a network and capable of sharing and/or receiving data. 
It includes devices such as PC, printers, mobile phones, etc. 

• Communication link: A communication channel that connects two devices in a network. The connection can be 
physical through cables like copper wire, optical fiber or can be wireless like the use of radio waves.    

Reasons for establishing a network: 

Enables easy sharing of resources between network users and processors. 
Provides network users with maximum performance at minimum cost. 
Software and hardware compatibility. 
Centralized management and allocation of network resources. 
Types of Networks 

A computer network can transmit data by two methods- 

1) Point-to-Point: A dedicated communication channel or link connects 2 devices. The two connected devices use the full 
capacity of the channel as no other devices are connected. 


 2)Multipoint (Broadcast): More than two devices share a single link. Channel capacity 
is shared between connected devices. 


Network Topology
Abstract

Network topology is the arrangement of nodes and links of a network.
Topologies are categorized as either physical network topology or logical network topology. 
The topology of a network is key to determining its performance. 
Network topology can be categorized into - Bus Topology, Ring Topology, Star Topology, Mesh Topology, Tree Topology.


Definition: Network topology tells us about the way the links and nodes/devices are connected i.e.,
it refers to the layout or arrangement of nodes and links in a computer network. 

Categories of network topology: 

Physical Topology: Describes the placement of various nodes in a computer network. 
In other words, it shows how network devices are physically connected. 
Logical Topology: Describes the idea of in what way different nodes are connected and how the data is 
transmitted through the network. So logical topology deals with the data flow in the network. 
Now let us understand why we need network topology. 

Network topology plays a key role while establishing a network, some reasons are: 

Based on the topology used, network performance will be impacted. 
Topology acts as a factor in determining the media type used to cable the network. 
Depending on the topology cost of the network will be affected.  
Types of Network Topologies:
Bus Topology
It is a multipoint connection in which every node/device is connected to a single cable (Backbone cable) via drop lines. 

Bus topology consists of two ends and data is transmitted from one end to another in a single direction 
i.e., bus topology is unidirectional.  

Terminators are used at the end of the cable so that the electrical signal does notbounce back. 

If the bus topology contains N nodes, then the number of cables required to connect them will be 
equal to N+1 where N is the number of drop lines and 1 for the backbone cable. 

Advantages: 
Requires a lesser number of cables. 
Easy to install and extend. 
Suitable for temporary and small networks. 

Disadvantages: 
Fault detection is difficult. 
The entire network shuts down if the main cable breaks. 
Limited cable length. 
Transmission speed decreases when more devices are added to the network. 
Low security. 

Ring Topology
In a ring topology, all the nodes are connected to form a ring 
such that every node will have exactly two neighbors. 

The signal is passed in one direction from one device to another device until it reaches its destination.
For the signal to reach from one point to another it must travel through all the intermediate nodes. 

If the ring topology contains N nodes, then the number of cables required to connect them will be equal to N. 

Advantages:
Point-to-point connectivity of the nodes makes it easy to detect and identify faults.
Easy to install.
Cost-effective and inexpensive to install.
Extending or reducing a node from topology is easy as only two links are required to be changed.
The risk of collision is less as only one node is allowed to send data at a time.

Disadvantages:
If a single node or a transmission line fails, the entire network breaks down.
Communication delay increases as the number of nodes increases.
Less secure.

Star Topology
In star topology, every device in the network is connected to a central device called hub.

All communications are done through the hub i.e. if one device wants to send data to another device, 
it first has to send data to the hub, and then the hub sends the data to the designated target.

If the star topology contains N nodes, then the number of cables required to connect them will be equal to N. 

Advantages:
Easy to install and modify.
Failure of one node will not affect the entire network.
Easy to detect the failure.
Less cabling is needed.

Disadvantages:
If the central hub breaks down, the whole network collapses.
Too much dependency on the central device.
Mesh Topology
In mesh topology, each device is connected to every other device on 
the network through a dedicated point-to-point link.

So, if there are N nodes in the network then every single node is connected to N-1 number of nodes. 

If the mesh topology contains N nodes, then the number of cables required 
to connect them will be equal to N*(N-1)/2. 

Advantages:
No data traffic issues because of the dedicated link between two devices.
Failure of a link or a device doesn’t affect the entire network.
Because of the dedicated point-to-point link, this topology provides high security and privacy.
Easy to identify the fault.

Disadvantages:
The amount of cables required is high.
The cost of implementation and maintenance is high.
Difficult and complicated to install and maintain.

Tree Topology
Tree topology is a combination of star and bus topology. In tree topology, 
multiple star networks are interconnected with one another using a bus network.
This topology consists of a parent-child hierarchy.

Advantages:
Tree topology allows for the easy addition of nodes and network expansion.
If one segment of the network is down it doesn’t affect the other segments of the network.
Fault detection and correction is easy.
The whole network is divided into segments which makes it easy to manage and maintain.

Disadvantages:
The entire system is dependent on the central hub, if the central hub fails then the entire network fails.
Complex to design and maintain.
Tree topologies are expensive because of cabling.

Summary
Network Topology is the manner in which nodes/devices and links are arranged in a network.
Types of network topologies are -  Bus Topology, Ring Topology, Star Topology, Mesh Topology, Tree Topology.
Every topology has some strengths and weaknesses. So determining the right topology will depend on the needs and size of the network. 
Some of the factors considered while selecting a network topology are reliability, security, cost, and scalability of the topology.

Define bandwidth, node and link ? 
Bandwidth is the data transfer capacity of a computer network in bits per second (Bps). 
The term may also be used colloquially to indicate a person's capacity for tasks or deep thoughts at a point in time.

A network is a connection setup of two or more computers directly connected by some physical mediums like optical fibre or coaxial cable. 
This physical medium of connection is known as a link, and the computers that it is connected to are known as nodes.

=====================================================
Gateway:
A gateway is a network node that connects two different networks, often using different protocols, and facilitates communication between them.

Router:
A router is a networking device that directs data packets between computer networks, determining the best path for the data to travel.

Daily Life Examples
Gateway Example:

Internet Gateway: Think of your home internet modem/router provided by your ISP. 
It acts as a gateway, connecting your home network (LAN) to the broader Internet (WAN), enabling devices
in your home to communicate with external servers and websites.

Router Example:
Home Wi-Fi Router: The Wi-Fi router in your home directs data between your devices
(like smartphones, laptops, and smart TVs) and the modem. It decides the best path for data to travel
within your home network, ensuring that internet access is efficiently shared among all connected devices.

================================================================================
DNS: Converts domain names to IP addresses for accessing Internet resources.
DNS Forwarder: Servers that forward DNS queries to upstream DNS servers, improving efficiency and reducing load.
NIC: Hardware that enables computers to connect to networks and transmit data, identified by a unique MAC address.


MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for 
communication on a network. It is a hardware address that identifies a device's presence on a network at the data link layer (Layer 2) 
of the OSI model. MAC addresses are typically assigned by manufacturers and are used for addressing and delivering data packets 
between devices within a local network.
==================================================================================
What is IP address, private IP address, public IP address, APIPA ? 
An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for 
"Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

Private IP Address - There are three ranges of IP addresses that have been reserved
for IP addresses. They are not valid for use on the internet. If you want to access the
internet on these private IPs, you must use a proxy server or NAT server.

Public IP Address - A public IP address is an address taken by the Internet Service
Provider which facilitates communication on the internet.

APIPA stands for Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). It is a feature or characteristic in operating systems (eg. Windows)
which enables computers to self-configure an IP address and subnet mask automatically when their DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
:A DHCP Server is a network server that automatically provides and assigns IP addresses, default gateways and other network parameters 
to client devices.It relies on the standard protocol known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server isn't reachable
===================================================================================
What is subnet ? 
A subnet is a network inside a network achieved by the process called subnetting which helps divide
a network into subnets. It is used for getting a higher routing efficiency and enhances the security of the network. 
It reduces the time to extract the host address from the routing table.

Firewalls 
The firewall is a network security system that is used to monitor the incoming
and outgoing traffic and blocks the same based on the firewall security policies.
It acts as a wall between the internet (public network) and the networking devices (a private network).
It is either a hardware device, software program, or a combination of both. It adds a layer of security to the network.

Types of delays::

Transmission Delay:
Definition: The time required to push all the packet's bits into the link.
Factors: Determined by the size of the packet (in bits) and the transmission rate (bandwidth) of the link.
Formula: Transmission Delay = Packet Size (in bits) / Transmission Rate (in bits per second)

Propagation Delay:
Definition: The time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver over the transmission medium.
Factors: Depends on the distance between sender and receiver and the speed of the medium (e.g., fiber optic, copper wire).
Formula: Propagation Delay = Distance / Propagation Speed

Queueing Delay:
Definition: The time a packet spends waiting in a router's output queue before it can be transmitted.
Factors: Depends on the level of congestion in the network and the scheduling algorithms used by routers to prioritize packet 
transmission.
Impact: Can vary greatly depending on network load and router configuration.

Processing Delay:
Definition: The time it takes for a router or a host to process a packet header and decide where to forward it.
Factors: Includes packet inspection, routing table lookup, error checking, and other processing tasks performed by network devices.
Impact: Influenced by the complexity of protocols and the capabilities of network devices.

=================================================================================
Three-way handshaking is a method used in TCP/IP networks to establish a reliable connection between two 
devices (typically a client and a server). Here’s a short explanation of the process:

SYN (Synchronize):

The client sends a SYN packet to the server, indicating its intention to establish a connection and specifying an initial
sequence number for data transmission.
SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge):

Upon receiving the SYN packet, if the server is available and willing to establish a connection, it responds with a SYN-ACK packet.
This packet acknowledges the client's SYN packet and includes its own initial sequence number.
ACK (Acknowledge):

Finally, the client acknowledges the server's SYN-ACK packet by sending an ACK packet. This packet confirms receipt of the server's 
SYN-ACK packet and completes the three-way handshake process. From this point onwards, both sides can start exchanging data packets 
reliably.
Purpose: Three-way handshaking ensures that both the client and server agree on the initial sequence numbers for data transmission and
confirms that each party is ready to establish a connection before actual data transmission begins. This process helps in establishing
reliable connections in TCP/IP networks, mitigating potential issues like packet loss and ensuring data integrity.

==============================================================================================================
RSA Algorithm 
RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e.
Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes, the Public Key is given to everyone and the Private key is kept private.

An example of asymmetric cryptography : A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data. 
The server encrypts the data using the client's public key and sends the encrypted data. Client receives this data and decrypts it. 
Since this is asymmetric, nobody else except the browser can decrypt the data even if a third party has the public key of the browser.
===============================================================================================================
What is HTTP and HTTPS protocol ? 
HTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol which defines the set of rules and standards on how the information
can be transmitted on the World Wide Web (WWW). It helps the web browsers and web servers for communication. 
It is a ‘stateless protocol’ where each command is independent with respect to the previous command. 
HTTP is an application layer protocol built upon the TCP. It uses port 80 by default. HTTPS is the HyperText Transfer Protocol
Secure or Secure HTTP. It is an advanced and a secured version of HTTP. On top of HTTP, SSL/TLS protocol is used to provide security.
It enables secure transactions by encrypting the communication and also helps identify network servers securely. 
It uses port 443 by default.
====================================================================================================
SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP sets the rule for communication between servers. 
This set of rules helps the software to transmit emails over the internet. 
It supports both End-to-End and Store-and-Forward methods. It is in always-listening mode on port 25.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol.
A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. 
Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, andefficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP.
TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data.
UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums.
==================================================================================================
A server-side load balancer is a component in a network architecture that distributes incoming client requests
across multiple servers or backend resources. Here's a concise explanation:

Function:
Distribution: It evenly distributes incoming network traffic or client requests across multiple servers.
Optimization: Helps optimize resource utilization, improve responsiveness, and maintain high availability.
Advantages:
Enhanced Performance: It helps in balancing the load, which helps in avoiding
==============================================================================================
What happens when you enter “google.com”?????????????????? (very very famous question) 
Check the browser cache first if the content is fresh and present in the cache display the same.
If not, the browser checks if the IP of the URL is present in the cache (browser and OS) if not then requests 
the OS to do a DNS lookup using UDP to get the corresponding IP address of the URL from the DNS server to establish 
a new TCP connection.
A new TCP connection is set between the browser and the server using three-way handshaking.
An HTTP request is sent to the server using the TCP connection.
The web servers running on the Servers handle the incoming HTTP request and send the HTTP response.
The browser processes the HTTP response sent by the server and may close the TCP connection or reuse the same for future requests.
If the response data is cacheable then browsers cache the same.
Browser decodes the response and renders the content.
=============================================================================================
Hub vs Switch 
Hub: Hub is a networking device which is used to transmit the signal to each port
(except one port) to respond from which the signal was received. Hub is operated on a Physical layer.
In this packet filtering is not available. It is of two types: Active Hub, Passive Hub.

Switch: Switch is a network device which is used to enable the connection
establishment and connection termination on the basis of need. Switch is operated on the Data link layer. 
In this packet filtering is available. It is a type of full duplex
transmission mode and it is also called an efficient bridge.

VPN, advantages and disadvantages of it 
VPN (Virtual Private Network) : VPN or the Virtual Private Network is a private WAN
(Wide Area Network) built on the internet. It allows the creation of a secured tunnel
(protected network) between different networks using the internet (public network).
By using the VPN, a client can connect to the organisation’s network remotely.

Advantages of VPN :
1. VPN is used to connect offices in different geographical locations remotely and is
cheaper when compared to WAN connections.
2. VPN is used for secure transactions and confidential data transfer between
multiple offices located in different geographical locations.
3. VPN keeps an organisation’s information secured against any potential threats or
intrusions by using virtualization.
4. VPN encrypts the internet traffic and disguises the online identity

Disadvantages of VPN :
1. Not designed for continuous use
2. Complexity prevents scalability
3. Lack of granular security
4. Unpredictable performance
5. Unreliable availability

LAN
A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, 
such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network 
with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school.
